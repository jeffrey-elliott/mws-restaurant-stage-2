# mws-restaurant-stage-2
This is the whole project:

`/app` (my code)

`/service` (the dev server for the service provided)

To get this running, clone and then from the project root:
```
cd service
npm i
cd..

npm i
```
That should get all the prereqs; to run:

`gulp --api-key <<replace-with-google-api-key>>`

Once that runs, the servers should be started and the project should be available for review here:

`http://localhost:8234/`
